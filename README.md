# feruca â€“ Unicode collation in Rust

feruca is a basic implementation of the
[Unicode Collation Algorithm](https://unicode.org/reports/tr10/) in Rust. It's
current with **Unicode version 15.1** (and, correspondingly, **CLDR version
44**; see below). The name of the library is a portmanteau of Ferris ðŸ¦€ and UCA.

No `unsafe` is used directly in this library: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. It
relies on the well-vetted [bstr](https://github.com/BurntSushi/bstr) to accept
input (in the form of either `&str` or `&[u8]`), to perform UTF-8 validation,
and to generate a list of Unicode scalar values, which can then be processed for
collation. The idea is to be tolerant of input that may not be entirely kosher
UTF-8.

In describing feruca as a "basic implementation," I have a few things in mind.
**First**, the performance of the library could probably still be
improvedâ€”especially in comparison to the official C implementation, `ucol` from
[icu4c](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu), which is incredibly optimized. I no
longer run benchmarks against that implementation, but feruca was always slower,
and my guess is that it still is (though perhaps not severely). What I _do_
currently [benchmark](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/feruca-benchmarks)
against is the newer first-party implementation belonging to the
[icu4x](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x) project, which is also written in
Rust. feruca performs **up to 3â€“4x faster** than the icu4x collatorâ€”while having
a much smaller feature set. My priority as a solo dev was to produce a
relatively bare-bones implementation that passes the official UCA
[conformance tests](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/CollationTest.html),
as well as the tests for the "root collation order" of the
[Common Locale Data Repository](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) (CLDR).

**Second**, support for tailoring is minimal (so far). You can choose between
two tables of character weights: the Default Unicode Collation Element Table
(DUCET), or the CLDR variation thereof. The CLDR table then becomes the starting
point for actual collation tailoring based on language/locale. I have added only
one tailoring, intended for use with Arabic-script languages. It shifts letters
in the Arabic script so that they sort before the Latin script. This is enough
for my own work with Persian and Arabic texts. The CLDR table in its unmodified
formâ€”i.e., the root collation orderâ€”works out-of-the-box for several other
languages. I do plan to add more tailorings, but it will be a gradual process,
and driven by demand. Realistically, feruca will never have the kind of
all-encompassing, flexible support for tailoring that is provided by ICU. My
feeling is that there's a place for less sophisticated solutions, with simpler
APIs, smaller dependency trees, etc. (If you have thoughts on this, I would be
interested in hearing them.)

Apart from locale tailoring, you can choose between the "non-ignorable" and
"shifted" strategies for handling variable-weight charactersâ€”with the latter
being the default. There is also an option to use byte-value comparison as a
"tiebreaker" in cases where two strings produce identical UCA sort keys.

**Third**, this library has effectively just one public method, `collate`,
belonging to a struct, `Collator`, which sets the options. `collate` accepts two
string references or byte slices, and returns an `Ordering` value. It is
designed to be passed as a comparator to the standard library method `sort_by`
(or `sort_unstable_by`). See "Example usage" below.

For many people and use cases, UCA sorting will not work properly without being
able to specify a locale! Again, however, it is worth emphasizing the usefulness
of the CLDR root collation order on its own. When defining a `Collator`, you can
set the default options (see below), which indicate the use of the CLDR table
with the "shifted" strategy. I think this is a good starting point.

## Example usage

```rust
use feruca::Collator;

fn main() {
    let mut uca = [
        "Ú†Ù†Ú¯ÛŒØ²",
        "Ã‰loi",
        "Ã–tzi",
        "Melissa",
        "ØµØ¯Ø§Ù…",
        "MÃ©lissa",
        "Overton",
        "Elrond",
    ];

    let mut naive = uca;
    naive.sort_unstable();

    let mut collator = Collator::default();
    uca.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| collator.collate(a, b));

    for item in uca {
        println!("{item}");
    }
    // Ã‰loi
    // Elrond
    // Melissa
    // MÃ©lissa
    // Ã–tzi
    // Overton
    // Ú†Ù†Ú¯ÛŒØ²
    // ØµØ¯Ø§Ù…

    println!(); // Empty line for clarity

    for item in naive {
        println!("{item}");
    }
    // Elrond
    // Melissa
    // MÃ©lissa
    // Overton
    // Ã‰loi
    // Ã–tzi
    // ØµØ¯Ø§Ù…
    // Ú†Ù†Ú¯ÛŒØ²
}
```

## Conformance

The UCA conformance tests can be run with the command `cargo test --release`.
Please note that, as a result of this library's reliance on `bstr` for UTF-8
validation, any
[surrogate code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters#Surrogates)
found in input to the `collate` method will be converted to the standard
"replacement character," `U+FFFD`. Conformant implementations of the UCA are
explicitly allowed to follow this approach. It does mean, however, that a
handful of lines (out of hundreds of thousands) in the conformance tests need to
be skipped. If you look at the `conformance` function in the tests module,
you'll see that any line containing a surrogate code point is passed over.

## Bincode

The binary files included with feruca represent hash tables of Unicode data.
They are generated in a separate repository,
[feruca-mapper](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/feruca-mapper), and
serialized using [bincode](https://docs.rs/bincode/). You can rebuild them
yourself, if you prefer.

## Licensing

The text files in the `test-data` directory are covered by the
[Unicode License Agreement](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt). Everything
else is MIT-licensed.
